## yamll

A utility to facilitate the inclusion of sub-YAML files as libraries.

### Synopsis

It identifies imports declared in YAML files and merges them to generate a single final YAML file, similar to importing libraries in programming.

```
yamll [command] [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --effective          when enabled it merges the yaml files effectively
      --explode            when enabled, it expands any aliases and anchor tags present. However, it might not produce the correct output when anchors and aliases are used across multiple inline YAML files. In such cases, use --effective instead.
  -f, --file stringArray   root yaml files to be used for importing
  -h, --help               help for yamll
      --limiter string     limiters to separate the yaml files post merging (default "---")
      --log-level string   log level for the YAMLL (default "INFO")
      --no-color           when enabled the output would not be color encoded
      --no-validation      when enabled it skips validating the final generated YAML file
      --to-file string     name of the file to which the final imported yaml should be written to
```
